This is SOME of RGStarter's custom JRPC class library for Xbox 360 Consoles. Feel free to use this in your own program if you would like.

This version of JRPC contains debugging for all functions as well as more to come. It will be updated here as more features are added when we
decide to release the full version of our custom JRPC library.
